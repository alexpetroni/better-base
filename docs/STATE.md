# STATE — after FIX-1 (atomic rate limiting + email-endpoint throttling)

## Remediation FIX-1 (audit Themes A & F — after Phase 7)

- **Shared rate-limit core** at `src/lib/server/rate-limit/` (framework-free;
  import the files relatively from modules/scripts like other shared code):
  `consumeRateLimit(db, table, key, { max, windowMs }, now?)` runs ONE atomic
  `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE … RETURNING` — window rollover is decided in
  SQL and the cap decision comes from the post-increment RETURNING values,
  never a separate read. Counters are **sliding-window** (aligned fixed
  windows; the previous window's count decays linearly across the next one),
  which closes the fixed-window boundary burst. Consequences to remember:
  refused requests still consume slots, and a maxed-out key regains full
  budget only after TWO aligned windows, not one. Works against any table
  with columns (key unique/PK, count, prev_count, window_started_at).
- **Migration 0010**: generic `rate_limits` table (for throttles without
  their own table) + `prev_count` column on `login_attempts` and
  `chat_rate_limits`. Applied to sleep/life/test dbs.
- **Login limiter** (`modules/auth/rate-limit.ts`): `registerLoginAttempt(db,
  key)` atomically counts the attempt BEFORE the password check; success
  still `clearAttempts`. 5 attempts per sliding 15 min per IP+email. The old
  pure helpers (getAttemptState/recordFailure/saveAttemptState/isRateLimited)
  are deleted.
- **Chat limiter**: `chat/rate-limit.ts` is now only `CHAT_RATE_LIMIT`
  (`{ max: 20, windowMs: 1h }` — shared `RateLimitConfig` shape, the old
  `maxMessages` field is gone) + key helpers; `service.ts` consumes the
  session and IP counters atomically via the core.
- **Public email throttling** (audit H2): the newsletter action and the quiz
  result `?/email` action call `consumePublicEmailBudget(db, scope, ip)`
  BEFORE any other work and fail 429 (form errors `rate_limited` /
  `rate-limited`, ro copy `newsletter_rate_limited` /
  `quiz_email_rate_limited`). Caps per scope (`newsletter`, `quiz-email`):
  **10/hour per IP, 200/hour global**, keys in `rate_limits`. A CAPTCHA/
  proof-of-work check would slot in right before that call — documented hook
  point in `public-email.ts`, deliberately not wired. Trade-off: a spent
  global budget refuses ALL signups for up to an hour (deliberate — worse is
  mailbombing victims and burning Resend reputation). Any NEW public endpoint
  that emails a visitor-supplied address must reuse this helper with a new
  scope.
- **Tests**: `server/rate-limit/core.spec.ts` (pure decision math) and
  `rate-limit.spec.ts` (integration: 30 parallel consumes return counts
  exactly 1..30); racing regressions in `auth.spec.ts` (20 parallel login
  attempts, exactly 5 admitted) and `chat.spec.ts` (25 parallel messages,
  exactly 20 streams) — both demonstrably FAILED against the pre-fix
  read-modify-write code; `routes/(public)/public-email-throttle.spec.ts`
  invokes the REAL route actions. **Vitest gotcha discovered there:** `$env`
  values are a build-time snapshot — overriding `process.env` in a spec does
  NOT redirect `getDb()`; mock `$lib/db` (vi.mock + vi.hoisted holder) to
  point route code at TEST_DATABASE_URL.
- e2e `global-setup.ts` now also clears `rate_limits` each run (counters
  outlive a run; the funnel/quiz specs send real signups).

## What exists

- **pnpm workspace**: `apps/web` (SvelteKit 2, Svelte 5 runes, TS strict, Tailwind v4,
  Paraglide with base locale `ro` + `en`, adapter-node) and `packages/formcomp`
  (vendored quiz form library, consumed as `formcomp` workspace dep; its `dist/` is
  built by the root `prepare` script on `pnpm install`).
- **Site config system** (`apps/web/src/lib/config/`):
  - `pillars.ts` — the 9 canonical pillars (ro slugs: `somn`, `nutritie`, `miscare`,
    `stres`, `relatii`, `scop`, `mediu`, `minte`, `finante`).
  - `sites/sleep.ts` (1 pillar) and `sites/life.ts` (9 pillars) — the ONLY places a
    brand string may appear. Shape: `{ id, name, domain, locales, pillars, theme, nav,
chatPersonaKey, email }`.
  - `index.ts` — pure `resolveSiteConfig(siteId)` (throws on missing/unknown id or
    non-canonical pillar). Server code gets the active config via
    `getSite()` from `$lib/server/site` (reads `SITE_ID` from `$env/dynamic/private`,
    memoized per process).
- **Compose stack** (root `docker-compose.yml`): `db` (Postgres 16, host port
  `${DB_PORT:-5433}`; 5432 was taken on this host), `minio` (S3 API on
  `${MINIO_PORT:-9000}`, console on `${MINIO_CONSOLE_PORT:-9001}`) and `imgproxy`
  (host port `${IMGPROXY_PORT:-8888}`, signature required, reads sources from
  `s3://…` via `http://minio:9000` inside the compose network). All dev
  credentials/keys have compose defaults matching `.env.example`.
- **Database**: Postgres 16 (service `db` above). A fresh volume auto-creates
  `better_sleep`, `better_life`, `better_test` (see `docker/postgres-init/`).
  Drizzle: schema barrel `apps/web/src/lib/db/schema/index.ts` (composes future module
  schemas; core has `pillars`), client factory in `db/client.ts`, lazy app client
  `getDb()` in `db/index.ts`. Migrations committed under `apps/web/drizzle/`.
- **Seed**: `pnpm db:seed` upserts the active site's pillars (idempotent);
  logic in `src/lib/db/seed.ts`, entry `scripts/seed.ts` (plain `node`, Node 24 type
  stripping — keep script imports relative with explicit `.ts` extensions).
- **Modules**: `src/lib/modules/{blog,quiz,shop,chat,email,media,auth}/` with barrel
  `index.ts` each. ESLint `no-restricted-imports` forbids importing
  `$lib/modules/<name>/<anything deeper>` — cross-module imports go through the barrel,
  within a module use relative imports.
- **Public skeleton**: config-driven root layout (site name, nav, theme tokens emitted
  as CSS vars `--color-*` on a wrapper div), homepage listing active pillars
  (`data-testid="pillar-item"`), `/sanatate/[pillar]` landing (404 for inactive/unknown
  pillars), `+error.svelte`, `/dev/form` proving formcomp integration.

## Auth & admin (Phase 1)

- **modules/auth** (`apps/web/src/lib/modules/auth/`): better-auth 1.6 with the
  Drizzle adapter (`usePlural: true` — tables `users`, `sessions`, `accounts`,
  `verifications`). Email+password only, **public signup disabled**, password min
  length 12. `users.role` is a better-auth additionalField: `'admin' | 'editor'`
  (default `editor`, `input: false` so it can never come from a request).
  - `auth.ts` — framework-free `createAuth({ db, secret, baseURL, plugins })`
    factory (no `$env`/`$app` imports) used by the CLI, tests and e2e setup.
  - `server.ts` — lazy `getAuth()` for the app: reads `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` +
    `PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, wires the `sveltekitCookies` plugin so `auth.api` calls in
    form actions set cookies. Session cookie: httpOnly, SameSite=lax; Secure is
    derived by better-auth from an https `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (so secure in prod).
  - `guards.ts` — pure `guardAdminPath(pathname, role)` →
    allow / login-redirect / forbidden. `ADMIN_ONLY_SECTIONS = products, orders,
subscribers, settings` (editors are blocked there; everything else under
    /admin needs any staff session).
  - `rate-limit.ts` — login rate limit, 5 failed attempts / 15 min per IP+email,
    fixed window persisted in `login_attempts` (pure logic + Db helpers).
  - `staff.ts` — `upsertStaffUser(auth, { email, password, role })`: idempotent
    on email (creates user + credential account, or updates role/password via
    better-auth's internal adapter, hashing included).
- **Creating users**: `pnpm user:create -- --email a@b.ro --password 'min12chars…'
--role admin|editor [--name X]` (root script → `apps/web/scripts/user-create.ts`,
  plain node against `DATABASE_URL`; needs `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`). Idempotent:
  rerunning with the same email updates role+password.
- **Auth flow**: `/admin/login` form action calls `auth.api.signInEmail` (rate
  limit checked first; failures recorded; success clears the counter) →
  redirect to `/admin`. Logout is a POST action at `/admin/logout` →
  `auth.api.signOut` → back to login. There is NO `/api/auth/*` catch-all —
  all auth goes through form actions.
- **Guarding**: `hooks.server.ts` (`handleAdminGuard`, after paraglide in the
  sequence) resolves the session ONLY for `/admin*` paths, fills
  `event.locals.user` (`{ id, email, name, role }` — typed in `app.d.ts`), then
  enforces `guardAdminPath`: anonymous → 303 `/admin/login`; editor on an
  admin-only section → 403. Role checks are server-side; the sidebar also
  filters entries per role (cosmetic).
- **Routes layout**: public pages moved into `src/routes/(public)/` (URLs
  unchanged; note route ids now include the group — e.g.
  `resolve('/(public)/sanatate/[pillar]', …)`). Root `+layout.svelte` keeps only
  theme/css; the public header lives in `(public)/+layout.svelte`. Admin shell:
  `admin/(shell)/+layout.svelte` (sidebar `data-testid="admin-sidebar"`, header
  with site name + user + logout) with dashboard (placeholder stat cards) and
  stub pages: media→phase 2, articles→3, quizzes/subscribers→4,
  products/orders→5, settings→7. `admin/login` sits outside the shell group.

## Media (Phase 2)

- **modules/media** (`apps/web/src/lib/modules/media/`), with TWO barrels — this
  phase introduced the pattern (ESLint now allows both):
  - `$lib/modules/media` (universal): the `<Img>` component, upload validation
    (`ALLOWED_IMAGE_MIMES` jpeg/png/webp/avif/gif/svg, `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` 15 MB,
    `validateUpload`, `mediaKeyFor`) and types only.
  - `$lib/modules/media/server` (server-only): everything that signs or touches
    storage/db — importing it from client code fails the build by design, because
    `IMGPROXY_KEY`/`IMGPROXY_SALT` and S3 credentials must never reach the browser.
- **Schema**: `media` table (migration `0002`) — text id (uuid), `kind`
  `image | video-embed`, `key` (unique storage path, null for video), filename,
  mime, size, width, height, `alt` (not null, default ''), `blurhash` (nullable,
  NOT populated yet — computing it needs pixel decoding, deferred), video
  provider (`youtube | bunny`) + external id, created_by → users, created_at.
  A check constraint enforces the image/video column shape.
- **URL building** (`imgproxy.ts`, pure): `signImgproxyPath` (HMAC-SHA256 over
  salt+path, base64url), `buildImgUrl(cfg, key, {w,h,fit,format,dpr})`,
  `buildSrcset` (1x/2x), `imageSources(cfg, row|key, {w,h,fit})` → serializable
  `ImageSources`. Server-bound shortcuts in the server barrel: `imgUrl()`,
  `imgSources()`. SVGs are emitted unresized/unconverted. The unit test vector
  was validated against the live imgproxy container.
- **Upload flow**: browser → `POST /admin/media/upload` `{op:'presign',
filename, mime, size}` (validates, returns `{key, uploadUrl}`) → browser PUTs
  the file straight to storage (presigned URL signs content-type AND
  content-length — a mismatching PUT gets 403 from storage; see
  `signableHeaders` in `storage.ts`) → `{op:'confirm', key, filename}` verifies
  the object exists, re-validates its real size/mime, reads width/height
  server-side (`image-size`) and inserts the row.
- **`<Img>`** (`Img.svelte`): takes a server-built `ImageSources` (`image` prop),
  renders `<picture>` with avif+webp 1x/2x srcsets and lazy `<img>`; alt comes
  from the row or the `alt` prop; empty alt without `decorative` logs a dev
  warning. URLs are signed ONLY in `load`/endpoints — components never see keys.
- **Admin library** (`/admin/media`, editor-accessible): drag&drop/click upload
  (multiple files), thumbnail grid via imgproxy, inline alt editing
  (`?/updateAlt`), delete (`?/delete` — removes object + row). Deletion is
  refused with 409 while any registered reference check claims the row:
  `registerMediaReferenceCheck({name, isReferenced})` from the server barrel —
  content modules of later phases MUST register one per media-referencing table.
- **Video embeds**: schema + `createVideoEmbed()` service exist and the library
  grid renders such rows as a provider/id card; there is no admin UI to add
  them yet (do it in the phase that first embeds video into content).
- **Storage** (`storage.ts`): `createStorage(cfg)` wraps the AWS SDK v3 client
  (`forcePathStyle: true`). NO MinIO-specific code paths anywhere — switching to
  Cloudflare R2 is purely `S3_*` env var changes (verified by reading the code:
  endpoint/creds/bucket/region all come from config; `ensureBucket` is only used
  by bootstrap/tests, R2 buckets can pre-exist).
- **Bootstrap**: `docker compose up -d` then `pnpm storage:init` (idempotent
  bucket creation; the e2e global-setup also ensures the bucket, and the fresh
  stack path — volume wiped, `up -d`, `storage:init`, full integration run —
  was exercised in this phase).

## Blog (Phase 3)

- **modules/blog** (`apps/web/src/lib/modules/blog/`), split barrels like media:
  - `$lib/modules/blog` (universal): `slugify`/`nextUniqueSlug` (ro-diacritics
    transliteration incl. legacy cedilla ş/ţ; suffix `-2`, `-3`, … on collision),
    `extractMediaRefs`, `ArticleRow` types.
  - `$lib/modules/blog/server`: services + rendering; importing it ALSO registers
    the articles media-reference check (module init side effect). It is imported
    for that side effect in `hooks.server.ts`, so the check is live before any
    request can hit the media library's delete action.
- **Schema** (migration `0003`): `articles` — text id (uuid), unique `slug`,
  title, excerpt, `body_md`, `cover_media_id` FK→media (set null), status
  `draft|published`, `published_at`, `seo_title`, `seo_description`,
  created_by→users, timestamps; `article_pillars` (article_id, pillar_id, PK on
  both, cascade). No site column anywhere — visibility is pillar tagging.
- **Services** (`service.ts`, framework-free `{ db }` deps, `BlogResult<T>`):
  `createArticle` (auto unique slug from title), `updateArticle` (patch incl.
  slug normalize+dedupe — an explicitly taken slug gets suffixed, re-saving your
  own doesn't; `pillarSlugs` replaces join rows, unknown slug → error),
  `publishArticle` (stamps `publishedAt` ONCE — republishing keeps the original
  date), `unpublishArticle`, `getArticle`, `getBySlug` (drafts only with
  `includeDrafts`), `listPublished({pillarSlugs, page, pageSize=9})` (published
  AND tagged to ≥1 given slug; empty list → nothing), `listArticles`
  (admin: status filter + ilike search), `listPublishedForSitemap`.
- **Markdown pipeline** (`markdown.ts` pure + `render.ts` db glue): marked with a
  custom image renderer + sanitize-html allowlist over the OUTPUT (scripts,
  event handlers, `javascript:` URLs, iframes to unknown hosts always stripped;
  src-less iframe shells dropped). `![alt](media:<id-or-key>)` resolves via
  `renderArticleHtml(deps, imgproxyCfg, bodyMd)` to `<picture>` markup
  (avif/webp 1x/2x through imgproxy, w=768) or, for `video-embed` rows, an
  iframe (youtube-nocookie / iframe.mediadelivery.net; external id validated
  against `[A-Za-z0-9_/-]`). Unresolved refs render as nothing.
- **Admin** `/admin/articles` (editor-accessible): create-by-title form → editor
  at `/admin/articles/[id]`; list has status filter + search. Editor: title
  (auto-suggests slug until slug manually edited — server dedupes on save),
  slug, excerpt, markdown textarea with server-rendered preview toggle
  (`?/preview` action), cover picker + inline-image inserter from the media
  library (`MediaPicker.svelte`), pillar checkboxes (site's active pillars
  only), SEO fields, save/publish/unpublish (publish/unpublish also persist the
  form first).
- **Public**: `/blog` (paginated cards, `?page=`), `/blog/[slug]` (drafts 404),
  pillar landing pages list that pillar's latest 6. Site nav configs gained a
  `Blog` entry.
- **SEO**: shared `src/lib/components/Seo.svelte` (title, description, canonical,
  OG, twitter card, optional JSON-LD — assembled with escaped `<` via
  `jsonLdString`) + `src/lib/seo.ts` `canonicalUrl(path)` from `PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.
  Article pages emit JSON-LD `Article` and a fixed-size 1200×630 jpg OG image
  through imgproxy. `sitemap.xml` (static pages + active pillar pages +
  site-visible published articles) and `robots.txt` (disallow /admin, sitemap
  URL) are dynamic routes — the old `static/robots.txt` was REMOVED, don't
  re-add it (it would shadow the route in the build output).
- **Seed**: `pnpm db:seed` also upserts 3 published ro demo articles tagged
  `somn` (fixed ids, upsert-by-slug, idempotent).
- **Typography**: `@tailwindcss/typography` is installed (`@plugin` in
  `routes/layout.css`); rendered article HTML gets `prose` classes.

## Quizzes, subscribers & email (Phase 4)

- **modules/email** (split barrels): idempotent transactional email.
  - `email_log` table (migration `0004`): every attempt is recorded — real
    sends AND dry-runs. The unique `idempotency_key` is claimed BY INSERT, so
    concurrent retries collapse to one row; statuses `sending|sent|dryrun|error`
    (only `error` rows may be retried, guarded re-claim).
  - `createEmailSender({ db, dryRun, from, replyTo?, transport? })` →
    `.send({ to, template, data, idempotencyKey })`. **`EMAIL_DRYRUN` defaults
    to TRUE** (only `EMAIL_DRYRUN=false` + `RESEND_API_KEY` sends for real, via
    the fetch-based Resend adapter in `resend.ts`). `getEmailSender()` (server
    barrel) is the env-bound singleton; `from` comes from site config.
  - Templates are typed functions (`templates.ts`, universal barrel):
    `quiz-result`, `newsletter-confirm` → subject+html+text, ro copy, all
    interpolations escaped. Add new templates to `TemplateData` +
    `EMAIL_TEMPLATE_KEYS` + the render switch.
- **modules/crm** (NEW module — subscribers live here, not in quiz, because
  newsletter signup exists independently; the phase plan left this open):
  - `subscribers` (migration `0005`): unique email, `consents` jsonb
    (`newsletter` / `profile_emails`, each `{ granted, at, source }`),
    `confirmed_at` (double opt-in stamp), non-expiring `unsubscribe_token`.
    Newsletter-mailable = granted consent AND confirmed_at.
  - Consent semantics (`consent.ts`, pure, unit-tested): callers pass only
    EXPLICIT intents — an unticked checkbox never revokes; re-affirming an
    unchanged value keeps the ORIGINAL record (proof of first consent, and it
    keeps retry idempotency keys stable). Revocation via `/unsubscribe/[token]`
    (revokes ALL consents, source `unsubscribe`) or an explicit `false`.
  - Signed action tokens (`token.ts`): HMAC-SHA256, base64url payload+sig,
    purpose + expiry checked (`timingSafeEqual`). Secret = `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
    via `getTokenSecret()`. Confirm tokens live 7 days
    (`CONFIRM_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS`); known limitation: an unconfirmed subscriber
    re-signing up gets NO fresh confirm email (same consent timestamp → same
    idempotency key) — the old link must still be valid.
  - Services: `upsertSubscriber` (normalizes email, merges consents, race-safe
    insert), `requestNewsletterSignup` / `sendNewsletterConfirmEmail`,
    `confirmSubscriber` (stamps once), `unsubscribeByToken`, `listSubscribers`,
    `subscribersCsv` (pure, quoted).
  - `NewsletterSignup.svelte` (universal barrel): plain POST to `/newsletter`,
    consent checkbox default-unticked + required; used in the public footer
    (`(public)/+layout.svelte`) and on `/blog`.
- **modules/quiz**:
  - Schema (migration `0006`): `quizzes` (unique slug, title, `intro_md`,
    `pillar_id` FK, `form_schema` jsonb = formcomp FormConfig, `scoring` jsonb,
    status, `result_template_key`) and `quiz_results` (quiz FK cascade,
    NULLABLE subscriber FK set-null, `answers` jsonb = sanitized formcomp
    submit answers keyed by stable uuid, integer `score`, `profile` jsonb).
  - Scoring engine (`scoring.ts`, pure, TDD): question specs `{kind:'map'}`
    (value→points; multi-select sums selections) or `{kind:'numeric'}`
    (clamped to question min/max × multiplier, then `cap`); dimension sums with
    ro labels; bands by ascending inclusive `min` (score exactly on a threshold
    → higher band; below all → first). Missing/unknown answers score 0.
    `maxScore` computed (null when a numeric question is unbounded).
    `validateScoringConfig(form, raw)` → ro errors for the admin editor.
  - **IMPORTANT**: never runtime-import `formcomp` from server/node code — its
    only export pulls .svelte files, which plain node (seed script, drizzle
    scripts) cannot load. `import type` is fine; structural checks live in
    `validate.ts` (`validateFormSchema`, `validateForPublish`); formcomp's own
    `validateConfig` runs client-side only (admin editor).
  - Services: CRUD with unique ro slugs (reuses blog slug helpers), publish
    gate (≥1 question + valid scoring), `getQuizBySlug` (drafts hidden by
    default), `listQuizzes` (+result counts), `sanitizeSubmittedAnswers`
    (drops unknown question ids, coerces strings), `submitQuiz` (scores +
    stores), `latestResults(WithEmail)`.
  - Funnel (`funnel.ts`): `claimQuizResult` upserts the subscriber (ticked
    boxes only, source `quiz:<slug>`), links the result row, sends the
    TRANSACTIONAL quiz-result email with key
    `quiz-result:<resultId>:<email>` (retries skip; a corrected typo still
    gets its email) and starts double opt-in when newsletter was ticked.
    `getQuizFunnelDeps()` wires db/sender/secret/`PUBLIC_SITE_URL`/site name.
- **Public routes** (`(public)/`): `/quiz/[slug]` renders MultiStepForm from
  the stored schema (ro default labels merged under stored `settings`;
  per-quiz sessionStorage key, versioned by `updatedAt` so edits discard stale
  answers; visibility = quiz pillar ∈ site config pillars, like articles),
  POSTs to `/quiz/[slug]/submit` (+server.ts: 256KB cap, sanitize, score,
  `{ redirectUrl }`) → `/quiz/[slug]/rezultat/[resultId]` (band, advice,
  per-dimension bars, then the OPTIONAL email step — result fully visible
  without it; `?/email` action). `/newsletter` (signup action + status page),
  `/newsletter/confirm/[token]`, `/unsubscribe/[token]` (both idempotent GET
  side effects, noindex).
- **Admin**: `/admin/quizzes` (editor-accessible; list + create-by-title like
  articles, per-quiz result counts) and `/admin/quizzes/[id]` — fields +
  form_schema/scoring JSON textareas (server re-validates; failed saves echo
  the texts back so edits survive), live client-side validation panel, an
  on-demand MultiStepForm preview (persist:false, doesn't store results),
  publish/unpublish (persist first), latest-20 results with subscriber email.
  `/admin/subscribers` (admin-only, already in `ADMIN_ONLY_SECTIONS`): search,
  consent badges with source, confirmed flag, CSV at
  `/admin/subscribers/export.csv` (+server.ts inside the (shell) group so the
  guard's section rule applies).
- **Seed**: `pnpm db:seed` also upserts a published ro sleep screening quiz
  `/quiz/evaluare-somn` (11 questions / 3 steps incl. a likert-batch, 3
  dimensions, 3 bands; content in `modules/quiz/seed-quiz.ts`), idempotent,
  tagged `somn` so it is live on BOTH sites.
- **Layout note**: the new dynamic public routes widened `$app/types`'
  `Pathname` union; `resolve(x as Pathname)` no longer typechecks (union
  defeats the overloads). Nav/config hrefs now cast to a single static route
  (`as '/'` / `as '/admin'`) — value is unchanged at runtime.

## Shop (Phase 5)

- **modules/shop** (`apps/web/src/lib/modules/shop/`, split barrels; the server
  barrel is imported from `hooks.server.ts` so the products media-reference
  check registers at boot). `README.md` in the module documents the design.
- **Money is integer cents (bani) everywhere** — DB, services, Stripe,
  metadata. `money.ts` is the ONLY place amounts meet strings:
  `formatCents(4990) → "49,90 lei"` and `parseLeiToCents("49,90") → 4990`,
  both integer/string math (grep-verified: no parseFloat/toFixed/float
  arithmetic anywhere in shop code).
- **Schema** (migration `0007`): `products` (text id, unique slug, name,
  `description_md`, `price_cents` int, currency `ron`, `stripe_product_id`,
  `stripe_price_id`, status `draft|active|archived`, `cover_media_id`
  FK→media set-null, `gallery` jsonb media-id array, `stock` nullable int —
  null = untracked, timestamps), `product_pillars` (join, cascade),
  `orders` (id, email, UNIQUE `stripe_session_id` — the idempotency anchor,
  `stripe_payment_intent`, `amount_total_cents`, currency, status
  `pending|paid|failed|refunded`, `shipping_address` jsonb, created_at),
  `order_items` (order FK cascade, product FK set-null, name+`price_cents`
  snapshot, qty).
- **StripeGateway** (`gateway.ts`): every Stripe API call goes through this
  interface. `getStripeGateway()` (server barrel) returns the REAL gateway
  (`stripe-gateway.ts`) only when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is non-empty; otherwise
  the deterministic in-memory mock (`mock-gateway.ts`, sessions
  `cs_test_mock_N` → `https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_test_mock_N`).
  Dev, vitest and e2e all run on the mock (playwright config forces
  `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=''`), so no test can ever call Stripe.
- **Sync** (`sync.ts`): saving a product in admin upserts the Stripe product
  and creates a new price + archives the replaced one when the amount changed
  (`syncProductToStripe`). Checkout does NOT depend on sync — sessions use
  inline `price_data` snapshotted from our DB rows.
- **Cart**: httpOnly cookie `cart` of `{productId, qty}` lines; pure logic in
  `cart.ts` (add/setQty/remove/count, qty clamped 1–99, max 7 distinct lines
  so the checkout metadata snapshot fits Stripe's 500-char value limit),
  cookie glue in `$lib/server/cart.ts`. Prices are never trusted from the
  cookie — always re-read from the DB. Header badge is server-rendered from
  the layout load (`cartCount` in `App.PageData`; a page load that mutates
  the cart cookie must override it — the checkout success page returns
  `cartCount: 0` because the layout load may read the cookie first).
- **Checkout** (`checkout.ts`): `createCheckoutFromCart` filters the cart to
  visible+purchasable products, drops out-of-stock lines (error if anything
  was dropped: `unavailable-items`), creates the session (RON, shipping
  address collection RO, success `/cos/succes?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
  cancel `/cos`, both from `PUBLIC_SITE_URL`) and the `?/checkout` action on
  `/cos` 303-redirects to the session URL. The cart snapshot travels in
  session metadata (`cart` = JSON `[{i,q,p}]`, built/parsed by
  `buildCartMetadata`/`parseCartMetadata`).
- **Webhook** `POST /api/stripe/webhook`: `verifyStripeEvent` (SDK's offline
  signature check against `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`; bad/missing signature →
  400, nothing written). `processStripeEvent`:
  `checkout.session.completed` → insert order + items in a transaction keyed
  on the UNIQUE session id (a duplicate delivery hits the constraint and
  returns `duplicate-session` — exactly one order), decrement tracked stock
  floored at 0 (untracked stays null), send the `order-confirmation` email
  through modules/email with idempotency key `order-confirmation:<orderId>`;
  `charge.refunded` → mark the matching order `refunded`. Unhandled event
  types are acknowledged (`ignored`). Always 200 + `{received, outcome}` for
  verified events.
- **Public routes**: `/magazin` (grid of `active` products tagged to the
  site's pillars — same visibility rule as blog/quiz; out-of-stock badge),
  `/magazin/[slug]` (gallery via `<Img>`, sanitized markdown description
  incl. `media:` refs, qty + add-to-cart form → 303 `/cos`; disabled
  "Stoc epuizat" button when tracked stock is 0), `/cos` (qty edit, remove,
  totals, checkout action), `/cos/succes` (order summary by `session_id`,
  server-side lookup; clears the cart; shows a "processing" state when the
  webhook hasn't landed yet). Nav configs have a `Magazin` entry.
- **Admin** (both admin-role only, already in `ADMIN_ONLY_SECTIONS`):
  `/admin/products` (list + create-by-name) and `/admin/products/[id]`
  (fields, price entered in lei → stored bani via `parseLeiToCents`, status,
  stock, cover/gallery media pickers, pillar checkboxes, Stripe sync status +
  manual re-sync action; every save re-syncs to Stripe when active);
  `/admin/orders` (list, ro status labels) and `/admin/orders/[id]`
  (read-only detail: items, totals, shipping address, Stripe ids).
- **Seed**: `pnpm db:seed` also upserts 3 demo `somn` products (mask 89,90 lei
  stock 25; tea 34,50 lei untracked; light 129,00 lei stock 8) with SVG
  placeholder covers+gallery uploaded to storage by the seed itself (no
  binaries in the repo; fixed ids/keys, idempotent — `seed-products.ts`).
  NOTE: seeding needs MinIO up (it PUTs the SVGs).

## Chat (Phase 6)

- **modules/chat** (`apps/web/src/lib/modules/chat/`, split barrels):
  - `$lib/modules/chat` (universal): `ChatWidget`/`ChatPanel` components, the
    `ChatProvider`/`ChatMessage` types, pure helpers (`selectChatProvider`,
    `validateChatMessage` ≤2000 chars, `capHistory` last 20, `mockReplyFor`)
    and `CHAT_ERRORS` (ro API error copy the widget renders verbatim).
  - `$lib/modules/chat/server`: schema, `handleChatMessage`, token helpers and
    the env-bound `getChatProvider()` singleton. The barrel calls it at module
    init and `hooks.server.ts` imports it, so `CHAT_PROVIDER=anthropic` without
    `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` refuses to boot (fail fast, never a silent fallback).
- **Providers**: `MockChatProvider` — deterministic keyword-based canned ro
  answers (somn/salut/test keywords + generic fallback, all with the
  no-medical-advice stance), streams word chunks; `AnthropicChatProvider` —
  `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, model `claude-sonnet-5`, `client.messages.stream()`
  yielding text deltas. Selection (`select.ts`, pure): mock by default;
  anthropic ONLY when `CHAT_PROVIDER=anthropic` AND a key is set. Dev, vitest
  and e2e all run on the mock — an ambient key alone never activates the live
  provider (unit-tested; playwright forces `CHAT_PROVIDER=mock` +
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=''` into both preview servers).
- **Personas** (`src/lib/config/personas/{sleep-coach,life-coach}.ts`): ro
  system prompts keyed by the site config's `chatPersonaKey`, resolved via
  `resolvePersona()` (throws on unknown). Prompts take `{ siteName }` at
  runtime — brand strings stay in `config/sites/*`. Both carry: pillar scope
  (sleep: somn only; life: all 9 from `CANONICAL_PILLARS`), a firm
  not-medical-advice stance, off-topic refusal style, and quiz-funnel nudges.
- **Schema** (migration `0008`): `chat_sessions` (text id, `anonymous_token`,
  created_at, `message_count`), `chat_messages` (session FK cascade, role
  `user|assistant`, content, created_at), `chat_rate_limits` (key, count,
  window_started_at — same fixed-window pattern as `login_attempts`).
- **Session ownership**: signed httpOnly cookie `chat_session` =
  `<sessionId>.<anonToken>.<HMAC>` (secret = `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`). Tampered/
  foreign-secret token → 403; valid token whose session was pruned starts a
  fresh conversation. No expiry claim — retention is row pruning.
- **Rate limiting**: 20 user messages/hour, per session AND per IP
  (`CHAT_RATE_LIMIT`), checked before anything is persisted → 429 with a
  friendly ro message rendered in the widget.
- **API `POST /api/chat`**: thin glue around framework-free
  `handleChatMessage(deps, { message, sessionToken, ip })`. Streams SSE
  `data: {"delta": …}` frames then `{"done": true}`; the assistant message is
  persisted only after the stream is fully consumed; provider history is the
  last 20 stored messages; `maxTokens` 1024. Errors are JSON `{ error }` (ro)
  with 400/403/429. `DELETE /api/chat` clears the cookie ("new conversation").
- **UI**: `ChatWidget` (floating, bottom-right, rendered on all `(public)`
  pages when the site config's `chatWidget` flag is true — both sites: true)
  and `/asistent` full page (`ChatPanel variant="page"`; nav gained an
  `Asistent` entry). Streaming rendering via fetch + SSE parsing, disclaimer
  line above the input (`chat_disclaimer` message), reset button. Conversation
  display is client-local (no history-restore GET endpoint yet — the cookie
  only gives the provider context continuity across widget reopenings).
- **Retention**: `pnpm chat:prune` deletes sessions older than 30 days
  (messages cascade); wire into cron at deploy time. Logic is
  `pruneChatSessions()` (integration-tested).

### Manual end-to-end verification with real Stripe (test mode)

Not run in CI/agent runs — do this by hand when you have keys:

1. In `.env` set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_…`, restart `pnpm dev` (the real
   gateway is selected only when the key is non-empty).
2. `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5173/api/stripe/webhook` and copy the
   printed `whsec_…` into `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (restart dev again).
3. Buy something on `/magazin` → Stripe Checkout test card `4242 4242 4242
   4242`, any future expiry/CVC, RO address → you land on `/cos/succes` and
   `stripe listen` forwards `checkout.session.completed` → order appears in
   `/admin/orders` as `plătită`, stock decremented, `email_log` has the
   `order-confirmation` row (dry-run unless Resend is configured).
4. Refund the payment in the Stripe test dashboard → `charge.refunded` flips
   the order to `rambursată`.

## Hardening & launch readiness (Phase 7)

- **Content export/import CLI** (`modules/content/`, node-safe; script
  `apps/web/scripts/content.ts`): `pnpm content export --type article|quiz|product
  --slug X [--out f.json]` produces a SELF-CONTAINED bundle (version 1):
  content fields, pillar SLUGS (ids differ per db), and every referenced media
  row incl. original bytes base64 (cover, gallery, `media:` body refs).
  `pnpm content import f.json` targets the CURRENT env's DATABASE_URL +
  S3_BUCKET and is idempotent by slug: images match by storage key, video
  embeds by provider+external id; a media id collision inserts under a fresh
  uuid and REMAPS the markdown refs + cover/gallery (`remapMediaRefs`).
  Pillars missing in the target db are skipped with a warning (content stays
  visible only where its pillar is active). Stripe catalog ids are NEVER
  imported (they belong to the source account). Import bundles are validated
  by `parseBundle` before anything runs. Second test db `better_test_b` is
  created on demand by the spec (and on fresh volumes by
  `docker/postgres-init`).
- **GDPR surface**:
  - `modules/gdpr/`: cookie-consent banner (`CookieConsent.svelte`, rendered
    by the public layout; cookie `cookie_consent=granted|denied`, ~6 months,
    parsed server-side in the (public) layout load). NO analytics ships; the
    hook point is `analyticsAllowed()` — any future analytics script must gate
    on it (comment in the component marks the spot). Playwright pre-dismisses
    the banner via `storageState` (a fixed overlay would block footer clicks);
    the funnel + home a11y specs clear cookies to exercise it.
  - `modules/pages/`: DB-backed simple pages (`pages` table, migration 0009),
    public at `/pagini/[slug]` (plain markdown render, no media refs), admin
    at `/admin/pages` (editor-accessible: list, create-by-title, edit
    title/body/seo). Seed creates privacy+terms ONLY if missing (`ensurePage`
    — re-seeding never overwrites admin edits). Footer links come from site
    config `footerLinks` (new `SiteConfig` field).
  - **Erasure CLI**: `pnpm subscriber:delete -- --email x@y.ro`
    (`modules/gdpr/erase.ts`): deletes the subscriber, unlinks their quiz
    results (kept as anonymous stats), anonymizes orders (email +
    shipping_address) and email_log (to_email + data) to
    `anonimizat@gdpr.invalid`. Integration-tested; idempotent.
- **Ops hygiene**: `GET /api/health` → 200/503 `{status, checks:{db,storage}}`
  (db `select 1` + storage HeadBucket — HeadObject can't detect a missing
  bucket; each check bounded by a 5s timeout; `$lib/server/health.ts`,
  integration-tested against broken endpoints). Unhandled errors: `handleError`
  in hooks.server.ts logs ONE structured JSON line to stderr
  (`$lib/server/log.ts` — ts/level/errorId/status/method/path/message/stack)
  and the error page shows the correlating errorId. 404s render the existing
  custom error page.
- **A11y**: `e2e/a11y.e2e.ts` (axe via @axe-core/playwright) gates home (incl.
  open consent banner), blog list+article, quiz, product, cart, /asistent and
  the open chat widget at ZERO serious/critical violations, both sites.
  Contrast fixes this required: public `text-(--color-ink)/60` → `/70`, life
  brand darkened `oklch(0.52 0.13 155)` → `oklch(0.45 0.13 155)` (white-on-
  brand ≥ 4.5:1). Keep new muted text at /70 minimum.
- **Performance** (`e2e/perf.e2e.ts`): rendered HTML never contains the
  storage endpoint (originals stay private; `plain/s3://bucket/…` inside
  imgproxy URLs is fine — that's imgproxy's server-side source ref); every
  `<img>` is imgproxy-served AND carries width+height (no CLS — the audit
  fails if the catalog renders zero images, so it can't pass vacuously); zero
  third-party requests on the homepage. **Fonts: system font stack on purpose**
  (no webfonts → nothing to self-host/swap, zero font CLS/latency); if a brand
  font ever lands, self-host it with `font-display: swap` and extend the
  perf spec. **Bundle review (pnpm build, adapter-node)**: client total
  ~446 kB raw; largest chunks 70/53/44/34 kB (≈20/20/14/13 kB gzip — Svelte
  runtime, formcomp, kit runtime); CSS 45 kB (7.7 kB gzip); no chunk is an
  outlier, nothing worth splitting yet.
- **Full-funnel e2e**: `e2e/funnel.ts` (shared impl) instantiated per site by
  `funnel-sleep.e2e.ts` / `funnel-life.e2e.ts` (skip when the project doesn't
  match): health check → home (pillars, consent banner accept persists) →
  footer legal page → pillar page → seeded article → quiz (20/32) → email step
  (both dry-run emails + consent rows asserted in db) → shop (CEAI, the
  untracked-stock product — deliberately not the ones whose stock the shop
  spec asserts) → cart → mock checkout 303 → signed webhook → order row +
  success page + order-confirmation dry-run → chat widget streams the canned
  reply. Global setup now also seeds demo articles + default pages.
- **Docs**: root `DEPLOYMENT.md` (env matrix per site, build/run, migrate+seed,
  R2, imgproxy + Cloudflare cache rule, Stripe webhook, Resend, cron, second
  site, post-deploy verification) and `LAUNCH-CHECKLIST.md` (human-only steps:
  accounts, lawyer review of the seeded legal skeletons, RO e-commerce
  requirements (ANPC/SOL, company id), DNS/TLS, live-Stripe test, Resend DNS,
  content review, ops drills).

## Known gaps / suggested next phases

- **Invoicing & shipping**: orders have no invoices (RO legal requirement for
  the business) and no shipping-provider integration (AWB, tracking emails) —
  the most likely next phase, see LAUNCH-CHECKLIST note.
- **Analytics**: nothing ships; wire a privacy-friendly script behind
  `analyticsAllowed()` in `CookieConsent.svelte` + add the cookie-policy
  copy when it lands.
- **Nurture sequences**: only transactional + double-opt-in emails exist; no
  scheduled newsletter/drip sending (needs a queue/cron design decision).
- **Chat history restore**: the widget's conversation is client-local (the
  cookie only carries provider context) — a GET /api/chat could restore it.
- **Media blurhash** column exists but is never populated (needs pixel
  decoding at upload/confirm time).
- **better-life content**: the platform boots as life, but pillar landing
  copy/quizzes/products beyond `somn` are seed-level only; content export/
  import is the mechanism for sharing what already exists.

## Key commands (all from repo root)

- `docker compose up -d` — start Postgres + MinIO + imgproxy (`--wait` works, all
  have healthchecks).
- `pnpm storage:init` — create the media bucket (idempotent).
- `pnpm dev` / `pnpm build` — dev server / production build (adapter-node).
- `pnpm lint && pnpm check && pnpm test:unit` — the phase gate; all green.
- `pnpm test:e2e` — needs the full compose stack up; builds, then runs playwright
  against two preview servers
  (port 4173 = `SITE_ID=sleep`, 4174 = `SITE_ID=life`); one build serves both because
  `SITE_ID` is read at runtime.
- `pnpm user:create -- --email … --password … --role admin|editor` — create/update
  a staff user in the `DATABASE_URL` database.
- `pnpm chat:prune` — delete chat sessions older than 30 days from the
  `DATABASE_URL` database (wire into cron at deploy time).
- `pnpm content export --type article|quiz|product --slug X [--out f.json]` /
  `pnpm content import f.json` — cross-site content sharing (bundle carries
  media bytes; import is idempotent by slug and targets the current env's
  db+bucket).
- `pnpm subscriber:delete -- --email x@y.ro` — GDPR erasure (subscriber row
  deleted, quiz results unlinked, orders/email log anonymized).
- `pnpm db:migrate` / `pnpm db:seed` — for the site in `.env`; for the other site
  prefix e.g. `SITE_ID=life DATABASE_URL=postgres://better:better@host.docker.internal:5433/better_life`.
- `pnpm --filter web db:generate` — generate a new migration after schema changes.

## Env & environment quirks

- `.env` lives at the **repo root** (see `.env.example`): `SITE_ID`, `DATABASE_URL`,
  `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, `PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `DB_PORT`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (new in
  Phase 1 — better-auth session secret; generate a real one outside dev). It is loaded by `vite.config.ts`
  (dotenv, never overrides real env), `drizzle.config.ts`, `scripts/seed.ts`, and the
  vitest setup file. In this agent container all service hosts are
  `host.docker.internal` (compose containers are siblings); `.env.example`
  documents `localhost` for humans.
- Phase 5 env vars: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (**empty in dev/tests → deterministic
  mock gateway**; set `sk_test_…` only for manual verification) and
  `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (any non-empty value for the mock/dev flow; the
  real `whsec_…` from the dashboard or `stripe listen` otherwise). The
  playwright config forces `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=''` and a fixed e2e webhook
  secret into both preview servers.
- Phase 6 env vars: `CHAT_PROVIDER` (**`mock` is the default** — deterministic
  canned ro answers; dev and all tests run on the mock) and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  (empty in dev/tests, never required there). `CHAT_PROVIDER=anthropic`
  requires the key at boot — the server refuses to start without it. The
  playwright config forces `CHAT_PROVIDER=mock` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=''` into
  both preview servers; no test can ever reach the Anthropic API.
- Phase 4 env vars: `EMAIL_DRYRUN` (**defaults to true** — record to
  `email_log` instead of sending; only `EMAIL_DRYRUN=false` AND a
  `RESEND_API_KEY` deliver for real; tests/e2e always run dry) and
  `RESEND_API_KEY` (empty in dev). `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is now also the base for
  links inside emails (confirm/result URLs).
- Phase 2 env vars: `S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_SECRET_KEY`, `S3_BUCKET`
  (`better-base-media`), `S3_REGION`, `IMGPROXY_URL`, `IMGPROXY_KEY`,
  `IMGPROXY_SALT`, plus compose port knobs `MINIO_PORT`, `MINIO_CONSOLE_PORT`,
  `IMGPROXY_PORT`. **Reachability rule**: `S3_ENDPOINT` and `IMGPROXY_URL` must be
  reachable by BOTH the server process and the browser (presigned PUTs and <img>
  fetches go directly from the browser). In this container that is
  `host.docker.internal:9000/8888` for both, because the app/vitest/playwright's
  chromium all run in the agent container while minio/imgproxy are siblings with
  host-published ports; on a human host machine `localhost:9000/8888` serves both
  roles. A prod split (internal S3 endpoint + public imgproxy domain) would need
  separate vars — not needed yet.
- Host port **5433** for Postgres (5432 is occupied by an unrelated container on this
  host). Container port stays 5432.
- **Playwright in this container**: chromium's system libraries were installed
  rootless — debs extracted to `~/chromium-libs`. Before `pnpm test:e2e`, export
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/chromium-libs/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$HOME/chromium-libs/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`.
  (On a normal machine `npx playwright install-deps` replaces this.)
  The dir does NOT survive a container rebuild — recreate rootless with:
  `mkdir -p /tmp/apt-lists/partial /tmp/apt-cache/archives/partial /tmp/debs`,
  `apt-get update -o Dir::State::Lists=/tmp/apt-lists -o Dir::Cache=/tmp/apt-cache`,
  then in /tmp/debs `apt-get download -o … libnspr4 libnss3 libatk1.0-0
  libatk-bridge2.0-0 libdbus-1-3 libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxfixes3
  libxrandr2 libgbm1 libxkbcommon0 libasound2 libatspi2.0-0 libdrm2
  libwayland-server0 libxi6` and `for d in *.deb; do dpkg-deb -x "$d"
  ~/chromium-libs; done` (verify: `ldd …/chrome-headless-shell | grep 'not
  found'` is empty with LD_LIBRARY_PATH set).
- Paraglide output (`src/lib/paraglide/`) is gitignored and regenerated; `pnpm check`
  runs `paraglide:compile` first so it works from a fresh checkout.

## Tests so far

- Unit: config resolver + canonical pillar invariants (`src/lib/config/config.spec.ts`).
- Integration: seed idempotency against `TEST_DATABASE_URL` (`src/lib/db/seed.spec.ts`)
  — drops `public`/`drizzle` schemas and re-migrates fresh each run; requires the
  compose db to be up.
- Unit: role guard decisions (`modules/auth/guards.spec.ts`), rate-limit window
  logic (`modules/auth/rate-limit.spec.ts`).
- Integration (`modules/auth/auth.spec.ts`, TEST_DATABASE_URL, fresh migrate):
  user upsert idempotency, session row on valid login / none on invalid, signup
  rejected. Vitest server project runs with `fileParallelism: false` because
  integration specs reset the shared test database.
- E2E smoke (`e2e/smoke.e2e.ts`): both SITE_IDs — site name in header, exact pillar
  count, active pillar page 200, unknown/inactive pillar 404.
- Unit: imgproxy signing/URL building (`modules/media/imgproxy.spec.ts` — the
  known-signature vector was verified live against the container) and upload
  validation/key slugging (`modules/media/validation.spec.ts`).
- Integration (`modules/media/media.spec.ts`, needs db+minio+imgproxy up):
  presign → PUT fixture (320×200 png from `tests/fixtures/`) → confirm records
  dimensions; wrong-content-type PUT 403s; signed imgproxy URL → 200
  `image/webp`, unsigned/tampered → 403; alt update; reference-check refusal;
  delete removes row + object; video-embed rows.
- E2E media (`e2e/media.e2e.ts`, both SITE_IDs): upload via the library, thumbnail
  actually renders (naturalWidth > 0, i.e. signed imgproxy URL served bytes to a
  real browser), alt edit survives reload, delete removes the card. Global setup
  also creates the bucket and clears the `media` table.
- E2E admin (`e2e/admin.e2e.ts`, both SITE_IDs): anonymous redirect, wrong
  password ×5 then 6th rate-limited, admin login→dashboard→logout, editor 403 on
  admin-only routes. `e2e/global-setup.ts` migrates BOTH site DBs, seeds
  e2e-admin/e2e-editor users and clears `login_attempts`;
  `playwright.config.ts` now injects a per-site `DATABASE_URL` into each preview
  server (derived from the root .env URL by swapping the db name).
- Unit (blog): slug transliteration/collision (`modules/blog/slug.spec.ts`),
  sanitizer XSS vectors + media-ref rendering (`modules/blog/markdown.spec.ts`).
- Integration (`modules/blog/blog.spec.ts`, TEST_DATABASE_URL, fresh migrate,
  all 9 pillars seeded): db slug dedupe, publish lifecycle (publishedAt stamped
  once, drafts invisible via `getBySlug`), pillar visibility against the REAL
  sleep/life config pillar lists (somn-tagged visible on both; nutritie-tagged
  invisible on sleep; untagged invisible everywhere — the SITE_ID=life DoD
  case), pagination, admin search, sitemap listing, `renderArticleHtml` by
  id/key + video rows, media reference check (cover + body refs).
- Integration (seed): `seedDemoArticles` idempotency in `db/seed.spec.ts`.
- E2E blog (`e2e/blog.e2e.ts`, both SITE_IDs): editor uploads a cover
  (own fixture `blog-cover.png` — media.e2e runs in parallel on the same
  library, filenames must not collide), creates/fills/tags an article, preview
  renders, draft 404s publicly and is absent from the sitemap, publish → card
  with real imgproxy-rendered cover on /blog, article page renders body +
  inline image, SEO assertions (title/description/canonical/og:type/og:image/
  twitter card/JSON-LD Article), sitemap entry, pillar landing card, unpublish
  → 404 again. Global setup now clears `articles` before `media`.

- Unit (Phase 4): scoring engine incl. band boundaries and max-score
  (`modules/quiz/scoring.spec.ts`), consent shaping (`modules/crm/consent.spec.ts`),
  token sign/verify incl. expiry boundary and tampering
  (`modules/crm/token.spec.ts`), email templates escaping + skip/retry
  decision (`modules/email/email.spec.ts`).
- Integration (Phase 4, TEST_DATABASE_URL, fresh migrate each):
  email idempotency — dry-run never touches the transport, concurrent same-key
  sends collapse to ONE `email_log` row, error→retry keeps one row
  (`email.spec.ts`); subscriber upsert/merge, double opt-in round trip via the
  URL recorded in the dry-run log, unsubscribe revokes, CSV escaping
  (`crm.spec.ts`); quiz lifecycle, publish gate, answer sanitizing, and the
  funnel — retried `claimQuizResult` yields exactly ONE quiz-result and ONE
  newsletter-confirm log entry, corrected email still delivers, unsubscribe
  after the funnel flips consent (`quiz.spec.ts`); `seedDemoQuiz` idempotency
  (`db/seed.spec.ts`).
- E2E quiz funnel (`e2e/quiz.e2e.ts`, both SITE_IDs): complete the seeded quiz
  (deterministic answers → 20/32, top band), consent checkboxes asserted
  default-unticked, result visible before any email, email step → both
  templates in `email_log` as dry-run, confirm link → `confirmed_at`,
  admin sees subscriber + result row, unsubscribe link revokes; plus footer
  newsletter signup from /blog. Global setup seeds pillars + the demo quiz per
  site db, clears `quiz_results`/`subscribers`/`email_log`, and the preview
  servers force `EMAIL_DRYRUN=true`.

- Unit (Phase 5): cart math incl. clamping and the 7-line cap
  (`modules/shop/cart.spec.ts`), money parse/format round-trips
  (`money.spec.ts`), pure webhook pieces — stock floor at 0, metadata
  build/parse, event shape guards (`webhook-pure.spec.ts`).
- Integration (Phase 5, `modules/shop/shop.spec.ts`, TEST_DATABASE_URL,
  fresh migrate, mock gateway): product CRUD + slug dedupe + unknown pillar
  rejected; **visibility against the real site configs** — somn-tagged
  visible on sleep AND life, nutritie-tagged invisible on sleep (the
  inactive-pillar DoD case), untagged/draft invisible everywhere; Stripe
  sync creates/reuses product + archives replaced price; checkout from cart
  (unavailable lines rejected); webhook happy path — signed
  `checkout.session.completed` → order + items + `email_log` row; tampered
  signature → no order; duplicate delivery → exactly one order; stock
  decrement floors at 0; `charge.refunded` → status flip;
  `seedDemoProducts` idempotency (also re-asserted in `db/seed.spec.ts`).
- E2E shop (`e2e/shop.e2e.ts`, both SITE_IDs, mock gateway): seeded catalog
  with real imgproxy covers, add 2 products, qty edit, cart totals,
  `?/checkout` action 303s to the mock checkout URL, tampered webhook
  signature → 400 + no order, signed webhook → order created, duplicate →
  still one order, stock decrement, success page (summary + cart badge
  cleared), admin order list + detail; separate test: tracked stock 0 →
  disabled "Stoc epuizat" buy button + catalog badge.

- Unit (Phase 6): provider selection incl. fail-fast and ambient-key
  resistance + mock determinism with a fetch spy proving zero network
  (`modules/chat/provider.spec.ts`), session token sign/verify/tamper
  (`token.spec.ts`), fixed-window counters (`rate-limit.spec.ts`), message
  validation + history capping (`validate.spec.ts`), persona resolution per
  site config — sleep→sleep-coach, life→life-coach, prompts differ and carry
  the required stances (`config/personas/personas.spec.ts`).
- Integration (Phase 6, `modules/chat/chat.spec.ts`, TEST_DATABASE_URL, fresh
  migrate, mock provider): streamed reply persists user+assistant rows and
  bumps message_count; signed cookie continues the session; foreign token →
  forbidden with nothing persisted; pruned-session token restarts cleanly;
  provider receives exactly the last 20 messages and the persona system
  prompt; 21st message in the window → rate-limited per session AND per IP,
  window expiry unblocks; prune deletes old sessions + cascades messages.
- E2E chat (`e2e/chat.e2e.ts`, both SITE_IDs, mock provider): open widget →
  disclaimer visible, streamed canned reply renders, reset clears the
  conversation + cookie and a fresh session works; `/asistent` full page
  chats; exhausting the hourly IP budget surfaces the friendly ro 429 message
  in the widget. Global setup clears chat tables (rate counters outlive a
  run).

- Unit (Phase 7): bundle parse/validation + media-ref remapping
  (`modules/content/bundle.spec.ts`), consent cookie helpers incl. the
  analytics hook point (`modules/gdpr/consent.spec.ts`), structured error-log
  formatting (`lib/server/log.spec.ts`).
- Integration (Phase 7): content export→import round trip across TWO
  databases (TEST_DATABASE_URL + better_test_b, created on demand) and TWO
  buckets — article/quiz/product, media bytes land in the target bucket,
  pillar mapping by slug (ids deliberately differ), id-collision remap,
  double import → no dupes, Stripe ids never copied, missing-object export
  refusal (`modules/content/content.spec.ts`); pages service — seed-once
  semantics (re-seed never overwrites admin edits), ro slug dedupe
  (`modules/pages/pages.spec.ts`); GDPR erasure — subscriber deleted, quiz
  result kept but unlinked, orders + email log anonymized, repeat run a no-op
  (`modules/gdpr/erase.spec.ts`); health checks against live AND broken
  db/storage endpoints incl. missing bucket and hung dependency
  (`lib/server/health.spec.ts`).
- E2E (Phase 7): full-funnel per site (`funnel-sleep.e2e.ts` /
  `funnel-life.e2e.ts` — see the Phase 7 section for the walk), axe a11y gate
  (`a11y.e2e.ts` — zero serious/critical on home/blog/article/quiz/product/
  cart/chat), perf gate (`perf.e2e.ts` — imgproxy-only images, width/height
  everywhere, no third-party requests). Playwright pre-dismisses the cookie
  banner via storageState; specs that audit the banner clear cookies first.

## For the next phase

- Admin screens land under `src/routes/admin/(shell)/<section>/` — replace the
  stub `+page.svelte` (they render `StubPage.svelte`; the only remaining stub
  is settings). The sidebar entry already exists; nav labels are paraglide
  messages (`admin_nav_*`). Articles, quizzes and products are full reference
  implementations (list + editor + form actions).
- E2E login: use `login`/`submitLogin` from `e2e/helpers.ts` — they wait for
  the `data-hydrated` marker the root layout sets on `<html>` at mount.
  Filling an input that has a server-echoed `value` attribute BEFORE
  hydration races: hydration resets it (this bit us as a flake). Wait for
  the marker in any new e2e that types into such inputs right after goto.
- Posting to a form action with playwright's `request` API: send
  `accept: text/html`, otherwise SvelteKit negotiates the JSON action
  protocol (HTTP 200 + `{type:'redirect'}` body) instead of a real 303.
- Sending email from a new module: `getEmailSender()` from
  `$lib/modules/email/server`, add a typed template in
  `modules/email/templates.ts`, and pick an idempotency key that is STABLE
  across handler retries (derive it from row ids / consent timestamps, never
  from `new Date()` in the handler). Shop order confirmations (Phase 5) should
  key on the order id.
- The quiz email step treats the result email as TRANSACTIONAL (sent to the
  given address regardless of checkboxes); marketing consents are separate
  records. Keep that split for any future email touchpoint.
- Public content visibility rule (articles AND quizzes): row is published AND
  tagged to a pillar that is in the active site config. Products should follow
  the same pattern.
- To show an image: build `imgSources(row, { w })` in a `load` function
  (server barrel) and pass it to `<Img>` (universal barrel). Never import the
  server barrel from a component.
- Any table that references `media.id` must register a
  `registerMediaReferenceCheck` at module init (see the integration spec for the
  shape) so the library's delete button starts refusing correctly.
- Module barrels: if your module needs $env/db-touching exports AND
  component/client exports, split them `index.ts` + `server.ts` like media does
  (ESLint allows `$lib/modules/<name>/server`).
- New admin-only sections must be added to `ADMIN_ONLY_SECTIONS` in
  `modules/auth/guards.ts`; everything else under /admin is editor-accessible by
  default.
- Chat has no history-restore endpoint: the widget's message list is
  client-local; the cookie only carries session identity for provider
  context. If a later phase needs it, add a GET to `/api/chat` that returns
  the session's stored messages after `verifySessionToken`.
- `locals.user` is available in all /admin server code (never null inside the
  shell). Add module schemas to the barrel as before — auth did:
  `export * from '../../modules/auth/schema.ts';`.

## Previously noted

- formcomp warns about `import.meta.env` usage during packaging (harmless under Vite,
  noted for a future minimal fix if it bites).
- `pnpm build` output: `apps/web/build/` (node server); previews use `vite preview`.
